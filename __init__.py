simpleScraper uses a pluggable XML or HTML parser to parse a
(possibly invalid) document into a tree representation. simpleScraper
provides provides methods and Pythonic idioms that make it easy to
navigate, search, and modify the parse tree.

simpleScraper works with Python 2.6 and up. It works better if lxml
and/or html5lib is installed.
